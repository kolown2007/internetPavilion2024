**InternetPavilion 2024**
<br>

**TL;DR**

*Philippine Islands - Internet Pavilion* is an online project that showcases works from artists making works in the Philippines. The projects are varied from gifs, videos, 3d objects, to interactive webpages.
We aim that the various works are accessible by people with low quality gadgets, network data cap, and slower internet speeds. 
The project is a work in progress.

**History**

pre-2020, it started as a joke. there was an initial talk with Mirjam  and the Siliman FA to create Visayas Islands Internet Pavilion as way where artists can still participate various festivals even if they cant travel to specific festival locations. The website and deployment pipeline were setup but there were a lot of challenges:

**Challenges**

1. Covid. some of us went home where internet was very slow. 
2. technical.we are trained painters. while we know some css in friendster days that wasn't enough for modern browsers.
3. Computers. our laptop cant edit even .jpg that time.

**Now**

In the succeeding days there were attempts but we moved on doing other projects. Until recently we binge-watched youtube tutorials on how to center a div and it worked!.
