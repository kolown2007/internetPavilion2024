**InternetPavilion 2024**

## TL;DR
**Philippine Islands - Internet Pavilion** is an online project that showcases works from artists making works in the Philippines. The projects are varied from gifs, videos, 3d objects, to interactive webpages.
We aim that the various works are accessible by people with low quality gadgets, network data cap, and slower internet speeds. 
The project is a work in progress.

## History
pre-2020, there was an initial talk with Mirjam Dalire and the Siliman FA to create Visayas Islands Internet Pavilion as way where artists can still participate various festivals even if they cant travel to specific festival locations. The website and deployment pipeline were setup but there were a lot of challenges:

## Challenges
1. Covid.. happened and some of us went home where internet was very slow. 
3. technical..we are trained painters.
