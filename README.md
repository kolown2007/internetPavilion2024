**TL;DR**

*Philippine Islands - Internet Pavilion*  is an online project showcases works from artists woeking in the Philippines. The projects vary from gifs, videos, 3D objects, to interactive web pages. The goal is to make these works accessible to people with low-quality gadgets, limited network data cap, and slower internet speeds. The project is a work in progress.

**History**

pre-2020, it started as a joke. There was an initial talk with Mirjam and the Silliman FA to create Visayas Islands Internet Pavilion as a way where artists can still participate in various festivals even if they can't travel to specific festival locations. The website and deployment pipeline were setup but there were a lot of challenges:

**Challenges**

1. Covid. some of us went home where internet was very slow. 
2. Technical.we are trained painters. while we know some css in friendster days that wasn't enough for modern browsers.
3. Tools. our laptop cant edit even a .jpg that time.
4. Data Cap. gosurf 50 wasnt enough

<br>

**Now**

In the succeeding years, there were attempts but we moved on doing other projects. Until recently we binge-watched youtube tutorials on how to center a div and it worked! We have also had a wifi connection since 2022.
 Based on our experience and capability, the current and future iterations of this project should prioritize gadgets that have low processing and slower internet speeds. But given that limitation we are trying our best to present the works as what the artists envisioned.
